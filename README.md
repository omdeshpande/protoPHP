# protoPHP
A lightweight, futuristic framework written in PHP.

# Vision
Today's frameworks have rigid back-bones. No framework is not suitable for all types of applications. At the time of selecting a framework for your app it isn't easy to predict how well your app will perform once the number users go up. Eventually, you hit a bottleneck at the framework level, either in terms of speed or memory usage. And you have to invest a lot of time in optimizing the framework to suit your particular need.  

What if a framework could be intelligent, have a fluid structure and continuously keep learning and adjusting it's structure based on usage and performance data that it captures from your app? You can use such a framework for any type of app without having to worry too much about framework optimizations. Wouldn't this be cool for all of us!

# Notes

1. This repository is useful for anyone who is keen to get hands-on learning experience in building an MVC framework from scratch. 
2. As you can see, the repo is at a very early stage. I commit to repository bit by bit on a daily basis.
3. Although this is more of a learning platform right now, the aim is to reach a point of maturity where the framework can be used by interested developers. So, the coding standards and coding quality will be top notch. 

Anyone out there who wants to chip in, you are welcome to!


# Current focus
1. The current focus is on writing the base controllers, models, views, request and response object classes.
2. Next focus will be on writing the ORM.
