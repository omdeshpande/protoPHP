# protoPHP
A lightweight framework for quickly hacking up 'prototypes'.

This repository is useful when- 

1. Lots of times one wants to hack-up a quick prototype without using any popular, heavy-duty open source framework. That's when you use protoPHP. It is extremely light weight and easy to get started because it cuts down on anything that one will not need, unless running in a production environment. 

2. Anyone who is keen get hands-on experience in building an MVC framework from scratch.

Currently, it is very very early stage. I will be adding to repository bit by bit on a daily basis. 

Anyone out there who wants to chip in, you are welcome to!
