# protoPHP
A lightweight framework for quickly hacking up 'prototypes'.

Lots of times I want to hack-up a quick prototype without using any popular, heavy-duty open source framework. That's when I use protoPHP. It is extremely light weight because it cuts down anything that I will not need, unless I'm running in a production environment. 

Currently, it is very very early stage. I will be adding to repository bit by bit on a daily basis. 

Anyone out there who wants to chip in, you are welcome to!
